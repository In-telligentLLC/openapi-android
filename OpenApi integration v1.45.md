## Purpose

This document is to provide guidance on how to integrate In-Telligent’s Open API Library (Framework) with your Android and iOS mobile applications.
The Open API library has 3 features:
#### Override DND:
DND Override feature will override the DND on the targeted device (iOS and Android) and raises the alarms / alerts for the following scenarios:
1. Device is in DND Mode
2. Device is in Silent Mode
3. Device is in DND Mode and manually silenced
4. Device is in DND Mode and the App is in idle state
5. Device is in DND Mode and the App is in killed state
6. Device is in DND Mode and the App is running in background
7. Device is in DND Mode and the App is running in foreground mode
8. Device is in DND Mode and Flight mode, and WIFI is enabled

#### Auto Subscribe:
Also known as Auto Grouping. This feature allows the device to automatically subscribe to all the nearest In-Telligent communities. This service will run in the background and automatically subscribes to nearest communities in following scenarios:
>1. When the app is in background state
>2. When the app is in foreground state
>3. When the app is in killed state

#### Language Translation:(#language1)
The alert notification can be translated into a different language for better reading in a comfortable language.

## Requirements (Development Environment)
#### Android:
- Android Studio
- Android Mobile Version 8.0 and above
- Open API library added to build.gradle file
- Partner Token
- Google account
  + Server-side implementation – (App Owner’s server)
    + Ensure the App Owner’s server API implementation is utilizing Google firebase as described in the following link:
      https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server
- The notification payload should be created as per sample listed in Section 6 Server-side implementation

#### iOS:
- Xcode 12 above
- iOS Mobile Version 12.0 and above
- Open API library file *
- Partner Token
- Apple developer account
  + Server-side implementation -
    + Ensure the App Owner’s server API implementation is ready to send notification payload as per the sample listed in section 6
* Supplied by In-Telligent

## About The Framework
The In-Telligent Open API framework supports the integration of In-Telligent proprietary code into any mobile application. Features include customer authentication, sending push notifications to subscribed users, automatically grouping users into “communities” based on real-time location and translation of text into any supported language.
#### Override device DND to receive push messages
This feature overrides a mobile device’s DND and silent mode features in order to force an audible alert to that device.
#### Auto-subscribe (Auto grouping) to nearest communities
This feature allows the device to automatically subscribe to all the nearest In-Telligent communities. This application will run in the background and listen for the device location change events and auto-subscribe or un-subscribe to respective communities.
The Auto-subscribe functionality triggers in two scenarios:
 1. **User moves away from Geo-fence range:** OpenAPI will un-subscribe the user from community.
 2. **User comes into a Geo-fence range:** OpenAPI will subscribe the user to the community.
#### Language translation
This feature translates the alert message to any available language.
Note: List of languages will be coming from the In-Telligent.

## Integration Steps
The following describes the required Android and iOS integration dependencies for the OpenAPI library.
#### Android
1. Open the Android Studio project.
2. Add the following dependencies as libraries: (app: build.gradle file dependencies section):

```
#### iOS
1. Open the XCode project in which you would like to integrate this framework.
2. Drag and drop “OpenAPI.framework” into the bundle folder.
3. Make sure this framework is added in both “Embedded Binaries” and “Linked Framework and libraries”
4. Import the following third-party dependency libraries:
```swift
pod 'Alamofire', '~> 4.9.1’
pod "RealmSwift", "3.17.3"
pod "SwiftyJSON", "~> 5.0.0"
pod 'DeviceGuru'
```
5. Install the above dependency frameworks by using cocoa pods.
Ref: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html
6. Add .mp3 files into your project bundle which are available in the framework zip folder.
7. Add OpenAPI Framework in Link Binary with Libraries at Build Phases and make optional (Other wise it leads to crash after build generation)
8. To generate the build please follow below steps
+ Select Project Target > Edit Scheme > Archive > Pre-Actions
+ Add Script
+ Provide build settings from – Select the App Target
+ Add the below Script
```swift
FRAMEWORK="OpenAPI"
FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/$FRAMEWORK.framework/$FRAMEWORK"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()
for ARCH in $ARCHS
do
lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
done
lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
```

## Feature Specific Instructions
#### Android - Override device DND to receive alerts
1. Add the Google Services plugin as the last entry in your app level build.gradle file:
```java
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'  // Google Play services Gradle plugin 
```
2. Add google services plugin to root level build.gradle file as below
```java
dependencies {
classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.14'
// ...
}
```
3. Add Firebase to your project as described in the following link:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client
4. Download google-services.json file (from firebase) and place in the app folder of the project structure.
5. Note down the firebase project server key from the project created in Firebase console. (Project settings -> Cloud Messaging -> Server Key).
**Note:** This server key is used in later steps to send notification from Server / rest client
6. Authentication: Before we call any service from OpenAPI, we need to authenticate the Partner token which was received from In-Telligent.
   There are 2 methods in helping the authentication process:
      1. CheckToken: – This is a method which looks for the authentication token in the application cache. (This will be by default false in the first run).
      2. authorization: - If the authentication token is not available, checkToken method returns false. Then a call to “authorization” method is required to get the authentication token and store it in cache.
      Generate Device Token as described in the Firebase SDK link provided above
      This token is required to pass on to In-Telligent servers to send push notifications to the device.
      **Parameters:**
      **pushToken –**
      Required - Yes
      Type - String
      ```java 
      OpenAPI.getInstance().authorization(pushToken, new Consumer<SuccessResponse>() {
       @Override
       public void accept(SuccessResponse status) {
        if (status.isSuccess()) {
         PrintLog.print(TAG, "Sign in received success");
        } else {
         PrintLog.print(TAG, "Sign in received failure");
        }
       }
      });
      ```
7. The following steps need to be added to the Application class and performed one time on initial launch of the mobile application:
   1. Initialize Open API
   Make a call to OpenAPI.init() method from Open API as described below
   2. Setup configuration
   ```java
   OpenAPI.Configuration configuration = new OpenAPI.Configuration.Builder()
   .setAppVersion(BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE)
   .setDebug(true)
   .setEnvironment(Environment.RELEASE)
   .setHeadsUpNotificationActionReceiver(new CallReceiver()).build(getApplicationContext());
   OpenAPI.init(getApplicationContext(), partnerToken, BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID, configuration);
   ```
   Below is the callback receiver and call actions in the application receiver from the library.
   ```java
   public class CallReceiver extends HeadsUpNotificationActionReceiver {
   @Override
   public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
   super.onReceive(context, intent);
   if (intent != null && intent.getExtras() != null) 
   {
    String action =  intent.getAction();
    PushNotification data =  (PushNotification) intent.getSerializableExtra(Actions.CALL_NOTIFICATION);
    NotificationManager notificationManager = (NotificationManager)context.
    getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
    notificationManager.cancel(Integer.parseInt(data.getNotificationModel().getId()));
    OpenAPI.getInstance().getAudioHelper().stopRingtone();
    if (action != null) 
    {
     if (action.equals(Actions.ACTION_MARK_AS_READ) && data != null) 
     {
      PrintLog.print("CallReceiver", "Mark as Read action");
      OpenAPI.openedAlert(Integer.parseInt(data.getNotificationModel().getId()), successResponse -> 
      {
       if (successResponse != null && successResponse.isSuccess()) 
       {
        Toast.makeText(context, “Alert open success”),   Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
       }
       else if (successResponse != null) 
       {
        Toast.makeText(context, successResponse.getError(),  Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
       }
       else 
       {
        Toast.makeText(context, “Alert open failed”, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
       }
      });
     } 
     else if (action.equals(Actions.ACTION_DELETE)) 
     {
      PrintLog.print("CallReceiver", "Delete action");
      OpenAPI.deleteAlert(Integer.parseInt(data.getNotificationModel().getId()),  successResponse -> {
      if (successResponse != null && successResponse.isSuccess()) 
      {
       Toast.makeText(context, context.getString(R.string.alert_delete_success),   Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
      } 
      else if (successResponse != null) 
      {
       Toast.makeText(context, successResponse.getError(),  Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
      } 
      else 
      {
       Toast.makeText(context, “Delete alert failed”,  Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
      }
     });
    } 
    else if (action.equals(Actions.ACTION_OPEN)) 
    {
     PrintLog.print("CallReceiver", "Open action");
    }
   }
   ```
   3. By default, OpenAPI library would be connecting to Production servers. Environment.RELEASE is the default configuration. You can change to Environment.DEV, to switch between Prod and Dev servers.
   ```java
   OpenAPI.Configuration configuration = new OpenAPI.Configuration.Builder()
   .setAppVersion(BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE)
   .setDebug(true)
   .setEnvironment(Environment.DEV)
   .setHeadsUpNotificationActionReceiver(new CallReceiver()).build(getApplicationContext());
   OpenAPI.init(getApplicationContext(), partnerToken, BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID, configuration);
   ```
   4. Generate Device Token as described in the Firebase SDK link provided above
   5. This token is required to pass on to In-Telligent servers to send push notifications to the device. Below code snippet shows how to update the FCM device token to Server on token refresh.
   ```java
   OpenAPI.getInstance().registerPushToken((token,new Consumer<SuccessResponse>() 
   { 
    @Override
    public void accept(SuccessResponse status) 
    {
     if (status.isSuccess())
      PrintLog.print(TAG, "Device Token Sent to server");
     else 
      PrintLog.print(TAG, "Failed to send. Please try again later.");
    }
   });
   ```
8. Enable additional DND permission –
   Some devices have additional DND settings to prevent the alert sounds. To handle the alerts in such devices, we need to request DND additional permission from user. If we enable the permission, the OpenAPI library will turn off the device DND for 60 seconds to play sound and then turns on the DND again (automatic).
   Make a call to the below method in the home activity to request this special permission. Without this permission also the app will work (make audible sound) in all the devices where DND additional settings are not manually enabled.
   ```java
   OpenAPI.checkDNDPermission(this);
   ```
9. Add the following permissions to the Manifest file (AndroidManifest.xml)
   ```java
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
   ```
10. Add the following service to the Manifest file within <application> tag
    FCMService is a the class which extends FirebaseMessagingService. The onMessageReceived method is called when a pushed notification is received.
    ```java
    <service android:name=".FCMService">
    <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
    </intent-filter>
    </service>
    ```
11. Runtime location permissions is required for authorization if autosubscription is enabled.
12. Setup the required Firebase methods as detailed in the following link:  
    https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive
    Override the onReceiveMessage method to receive the message payload and call below “relayPushNotification” method with message payload in the onReceiveMessage of FirebaseService.
    ```java
    OpenAPI.getInstance().relayPushNotification(remoteMessage.getData(), this, true,errorType -> {
    if (errorType == ErrorType.NOTIFICATION_PERMISSION_NOT_GRANTED){
    PrintLog.print("Tag", "Notification permission not allowed");
    }
    });
    ```
    **Note:** The notification will have three button option –
    1. Mark As Read
    2. Delete
    3. Open
    
    The variations are –
    1. In some devices these buttons will be visible by default.
    2. In some devices we need to expand notification to see the buttons.
    
    The notification is in expandable form with following variations –
    1. In some devices notification is expanded by default.
    2. In some devices there will be arrow to expand.
    3. In some devices on dragging down notification will expand.
#### iOS - Override device DND to receive alerts
1. In the project target folder -> Capabilities -> background modes enable the following:
   + Audio, Airplay, and Picture in Picture
   + Location updates
   + Voice over IP
   + Background fetch
   + Remote notifications
2. In Capabilities, enable Push notifications.
3. Register the application with the bundle identifier in apple developer website (https://developer.apple.com/) and enable VOIP services on the apple developer portal with the app ID and then create:
    1. Certificates: (Refer to the attached document - iOS Certificates creation process)
    2. Profiles: (Refer to the attached document - iOS Certificates creation process)
    3. Integrate: Install certificates by double clicking on the certificates. This is to run the development application in iPhone physical device and to send push notification using Pusher client.
       Ref: (attached document – iOS Certificates creation process)
4. For VOIP services,
       + Generate a P8 file in KEYS section in developer portal (Ref: attached document – iOS Certificates creation process)
       + Download the generated file
       + Integrate the above certificates with backend web services, which will initiate the notification (app owner’s server)
5. Authentication: Before we call any service from OpenAPI, we need to authenticate the Partner token which was received from In-Telligent.
      There are 2 methods in helping the authentication process:
      1. CheckToken: – This is a method which looks for the authentication token in the application cache. (This will be by default false in the first run).
      2. authorization: - If the authentication token is not available, checkToken method returns false. Then a call to “authorization” method is required to get the authentication token and store it in cache.
         **Parameters:**
         **partnerToken –**
           Required - Yes
           Type - String
         **email/mobileNumber –**
         Required - Yes
         Type - String
         **password –**
         Required - Yes
         Type - String
         **name –**
         Required – Yes (Name or empty string)
         Type – String
         Default – If empty, default is email/mobilenumber
         **gender –**
         Required – Yes
         Type – OpenAPIUserGender (OpenAPI library class)
      ```swifty
      OpenAPI.authorization(
      partnerToken: partnerToken,
      email: emailId,
      mobileNumber: mobileNumber,
      password: password,
      name: username,
      gender: .male){ status in
      if status {
      // login success
      } else {
      // something went wrong
      }
      }
      ```
6. For further use, need to capture device tokens from the following delegates methods
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken
deviceToken: Data){
let deviceTokenString = deviceToken.reduce("", {$0 + String(format: "%02X", $1)})
print("Pushtoken regular: \(deviceTokenString)")
}

func pushRegistry(_ registry: PKPushRegistry, didUpdate credentials: PKPushCredentials, for type: PKPushType){
var pToken: String = ""
for i in 0 ..< credentials.token.count {
 pToken += String(format: "%02.2hhx", credentials.token[i] as CVarArg)
 }
 print("Pushtoken voip: \(pToken)")
 }
```
7. In Order to receive PushKit notification / Regular notification from In-Telligent server, need to register captured device tokens (Regular Push token and VoIP Push token) with In-Telligent using OpenAPI method “registerPushKitToken” as bellow,
```swift
OpenAPI.registerPushKitToken(voipPushToken: voipPushToken, regularPushToken: regularPushToken){
(status) in 
completion(status)
}
```
8. When the Regular push notification payload is received on the delegate method, call the Open API method relayPushKitNotification and pass the received payload. The Open API library will handle the notification with the appropriate sound.
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void){
print(userInfo)
OpenAPI.relayPushKitNotification(dictionaryPayload: userInfo)
}
```
9. When the PushKit payload is received on the delegate method, call the Open API method relayPushKitNotification and pass the received payload.   The Open API library will handle the notification with the appropriate sound.
```swift
func pushRegistry(_ registry: PKPushRegistry, deidReceiveIncomingPushWith rawPayload: PKPushPayload, for type: PKPushType){
debugPrint("received push notification \(rawPayload.dictionaryPayload)")
// OpenAPI will parse your payload and play alert based on alert type.
OpenAPI.relayPushKitNotification(dictionaryPayload: rawPayload.dictionaryPayload)
}
```    
#### Android - Auto subscription (Auto grouping)
The auto subscription feature will subscribe or un-subscribe a device based on device location change events.  Once this functionality has been invoked, every user / device will automatically update into or out of In-Telligent communities when entering or leaving a Geo fence.
To implement this functionality, the following steps must be taken.
1. Initialize Open API
   The following method call need to be added to the Application class and performed one time on initial launch of the mobile application
   Make a call to OpenAPI.init() method from Open API
2. Authentication: Before we call any service from OpenAPI, we need to authenticate the Partner token which was received from In-Telligent.
   There are 2 methods for the authentication process:
   1. CheckToken: – This is a method which looks for the authentication token in the application cache. (This will be by default false in the first run).
   2. authorization: - If the authentication token is not available, checkToken method returns false. Then a call to “authorization” method is required to get the authentication token and store it in cache.
      **Parameters:**
      **pushToken –**
      Required - Yes
      Type - String
   ```java
   OpenAPI.getInstance().authorization(pushToken, new Consumer<SuccessResponse>() {
   @Override
   public void accept(SuccessResponse status) {
    if (status.isSuccess) {
     PrintLog.print(TAG, "Sign in received success");
     // register push token here
     } else {
       PrintLog.print(TAG, "Sign in received failure");
     }
    }
   });
   ```
   3. Auto Subscription: After authentication, the following method is used to initiate the auto subscription process:
   ```java   
   OpenAPI.getSubscribedCommunities (getApplicationContext(), new Consumer<CommunitiesList>() {
   @Override
   public void accept(CommunitiesList communities) {
   if (communities != null) {
    PrintLog.print(TAG, "SubscriberCommunities  received success");
    // Add communities to recyclerview adatpter
    } else {
     PrintLog.print(TAG, "SubscriberCommunitiesreceived failure");
     }
    }
   });
   ```
   This will handle the following functionality:
     1. Handling location change Events:
       1. Get the device location and listen for subsequent location change events. 
       2. Retrieving the Geo fence from server and automatically will add / remove Geo fence boundaries to / from the device. 
     2. Get communities and Subscribe to new communities list from server.
       1. Get list of communities from In-Telligent server API.
       2. Auto subscribe to the received communities from API.
   The above method is to be called after authorization and whenever app needs to start Auto-Subscription. 
   4. Community lists for a subscriber:
   After auto subscription has been invoked, handle callback method - getSubscribedCommunities () – to get a list of all communities that a device has been auto subscribed.  The following is a code snippet for this method:  
   ```java    
   OpenAPI. getSubscribedCommunities (getApplicationContext(),new Consumer<CommunitiesList>() {
    @Override
    public void accept(CommunitiesList communities) {
    if (communities != null) {
    PrintLog.print(TAG, "Subscriber Communities  received success");
    } else {
    PrintLog.print(TAG, "SubscriberCommunitiesreceived failure");
    }
    }
    });
   ```
   5. Permissions:
      Add the following Geo Fence services to the application manifest.xml file and then handle the permission request.
   ```java
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
   ```
#### iOS - Auto subscription (Auto grouping)
The auto subscription feature will subscribe or un-subscribe a device based on device location change events.  Once this functionality has been invoked, every user / device will automatically update into or out of In-Telligent communities when entering or leaving a Geo fence.
To implement this functionality, the following steps must be taken.
   1. Authentication: Before we call any service from OpenAPI, we need to authenticate the Partner token which was received from In-Telligent.
      There are 2 methods for the authentication process:
         1. CheckToken: – This is a method which looks for the authentication token in the application cache. (This will be by default false in the first run).
         2. authorization: - If the authentication token is not available, checkToken method returns false. Then a call to “authorization” method is required to get the authentication token and store it in cache.
            **Parameters:**
            **partnerToken –**
            Required - Yes
            Type - String
            **email/mobileNumber –**
            Required - Yes
            Type - String
            **password –**
            Required - Yes
            Type - String
            **name –**
            Required – Yes (Name or empty string)
            Type – String
            Default – If empty, default is email/mobilenumber
            **gender –**
            Required – Yes
            Type – OpenAPIUserGender (OpenAPI library class)
      ```swifty
      OpenAPI.authorization(
      partnerToken: partnerToken,
      email: emailId,
      mobileNumber: mobileNumber,
      password: password,
      name: username,
      gender: .male){ status in
      if status {
      // login success
      } else {
      // something went wrong
      }
      }
      ```
   2. Auto Subscription: After authentication, the following method is used to initiate the auto subscription process:
      OpenAPI.start(self)
      This will handle the following functionality:
         1. Handling location change Events:
               1. Get the device location and listen for subsequent location change events.
               2. Automatically add / remove Geo fence boundaries to / from the device.
         2. Get communities and subscribe to new communities list from server.
               1. Get list of communities from In-Telligent server API.
               2. Auto subscribe to the received communities from API.
               3. Save received communities into device local storage (DB).
      The above method is to be called after authorization and whenever app needs to start Auto-Subscription.
   3. Community lists for a subscriber:
      After auto subscription has been invoked, handle delegate method - subscribedCommunities( ) – to get a list of all communities that a device has been auto subscribed.  The following is a code snippet for this method:
      ```swift
      func subscribedCommunities(_ subscribedCommunities: [INCommunity]){
      print(subscribedCommunities)
      }
      ```
   4. Permissions:
      Add following permissions to. plist.
      ```swift
      // TODO:   add details
      ```
#### Android – Language Translation
The language translation feature will translate community notifications from the original language to any other supported language.
To implement this functionality, the following steps must be taken.

     // register push token here
     } else {
       PrintLog.print(TAG, "Sign in received failure");
     }
    }
   });
   ```
  3. Notification: After authentication and getting buildings the following method is used to get complete notification data according to notification ID.
   ```java
   OpenAPI.getCompleteNotification(int notificationId,new Consumer< Notification>() {
   @Override

## How to test
#### Android - Override device DND to receive alerts
**Using In-Telligent Portal**
You can use the In-Telligent portal to send notifications once section 7 (below) has been fully integrated on the In-Telligent servers.
   1. Launch In-Telligent web portal
         1. Prod: https://app.in-telligent.com/
         2. Dev: https://app.uat.in-telligent.com/
   2. Login using valid credentials.
   3. Click on “Communities” tab from top navigation.
   4. Select community from list to send alert notification.
   5. Once community page is opened, click on “send a community alert” from left sidebar navigation.
   6. Enter required fields, select type of alert and click on send button to send to subscribed users for selected community.
   7. Alert should send to the selected/all users in community.
**Using REST client**
The following approach can be used to test third-party application functionality without interaction with the In-Telligent messaging service.
**NOTE:** The In-Telligent messaging service can also be used for testing purposes once the third-party application has been fully integrated with the In-Telligent backend services.  See section 7 below for more information. 
   1. Use REST client to send notification to the device
      + Install Chrome extension from the following link. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/restlet-client-rest-api-t/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm?hl=en
      + Download the FCM sample request (attached here: FCM_Payload.json) and import into REST client (import json as rest client repository)

      + Replace the value for the "to" field with the generated device token (step 5.1), replace the value for the “key” field with the server key (noted in step 5.1) and send notification.
        **Note:** For actual implementation on the server (app owner server), please go through the below documentation.
        https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server
   2. Print and capture the device token from Log as soon as you run the application on the device.
   3. Use this device token, the server key (noted in section 5.1) and the following payload to send the notification.
   4. Device will receive the alert and the respective sound. If the app developer wants to show the alert within the application, please capture the details from the payload and display accordingly.
      A sample notification payload should be as follows:
      ```java
      {
      "data": {
      "payload_version":"2",
      "building": {
      “name":  "Test Community",
      "id":"12345"
      },
      "data": {
      "title": "test alert please ignore",
      "body": "test alert please ignore"
      },
      "notification"{
      "action": "pushNotification",
      "language": "en",
      "id": "12345",
      "type": "normal",
      "suffix": "to refer back to this alert or to see more information, please open the App"
      }
      /// Any additional fields you may want
      },
      "to": "fW40hcEO9PA:APA91bFJr2-nwkSuBfhL3_g2Q3iPZOZGcx-P6B_zVVR_7k1zMDC-qFIYcdzdNE_h2ecRO17Sw2tvcHp7xLkAArajyILRAgYolHJt8CuXo7t66TB48VoOeTdQPI-Mtq0HKjxKPXF4S_BM"
      }
      ```
      Description of the above payload parameters:

#### Android - Auto-subscribe to nearest communities
   1. Install and open the sample application in android devices
   2. A list of communities (nearby) for which the device is subscribed will be shown. As this auto-subscription is based on the user’s geo location, it shows different results in different locations. If there are no communities near to the user, the device will not be subscribed to any communities.
   3. To add new communities for testing purposes:
         1. Launch In-Telligent web portal
               1. Prod: https://app.in-telligent.com/

#### Send alerts to all subscribers
Testing can be done using the sample application that was shared as part of the build files. In Web portal we can verify it under community details in – View Sent Out Alerts

## Integration with In-Telligent
Any partner application is required to integrate with In-Telligent systems to maintain user authentication and to send notifications from In-Telligent portals.
In order to integrate, the following details have to be shared with the In-Telligent development team. Once the In-Telligent development team receives the information, it may take up to two days to integrate with In-Telligent systems.
   1. Android
      To send push notifications from the In-Telligent portal, your application’s firebase FCM server key has to be shared with the In-Telligent development team. This key can be retrieved from the Firebase console app created in Section 5.1 point 3.
         1. Locate the firebase project server key from the project created in Firebase console. (Project settings -> Cloud Messaging -> Server Key).
         2. Share the details with the In-Telligent development team.
   2. iOS
      To send Apple PushKit notifications from the In-Telligent portal, your application’s certificates are required.
         1. Generate a P12 file in KEYS section in the Apple developer portal.
         2. Download the generated file.
         3. Share the file with the In-Telligent development team.
